# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Full Stack Development > Lab: Classy Chirper

Still Working  All Finished
Classy Chirper
The goal of this lab is to convert, re-write, or from scratch create the same Chirper lab from the beginning of the React module. Except the design constraint is that it must be written using only Class-based Components.

 

Getting Started
Create a new project with Create React App.
Delete the src and public directory and all of its contents.
Create a new public directory and a new index.html file inside of public.
Use the ! emmet shortcut to generate a fresh html document in the index.html file. Place <div id="root"></div> in the <body> of the html document you created. (like we did in earlier videos!)
Create a new src directory and a components directory inside of src.
Create an App.jsx and a index.js file inside of src.
Write the basic "entry point" code for the index.js file, avoid copy/paste so you can practice writing it yourself!
// inside of src/index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
Write a simple function component that returns some JSX for your App.jsx file.
// inside of /src/App.jsx
import React from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Hello from App Class Component!</h1>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default App;
 

You should now have a project structure that resembles the following:

node_modules/
public/
|- index.html
src/
|- components/
|- App.jsx
|- index.js
.gitignore
package-lock.json
package.json
README.md
 

Instructions (same as before)
Your objective should be to create a "timeline" of Chirps -- short messages that you post on the Chirper platform.

Your timeline should load with at least three chirps.

Code a form with at least two inputs where users can submit new chirps from.

When a new chirp is submitted it should be shown back to the user in the timeline.

 

Hints
The walkthrough and lecture's reference material will serve as a great guide to completing this lab.
Remember that a lot of your code will start with this. inside of a class.
Remember to bind your this keyword by using arrow functions in your event handlers.
